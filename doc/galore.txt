Most of galore functionallity can be ran globaly, from anywhere but you want to make sure
that libs are loaded (they are lazy loaded by default). 

Here are 2 examples:
vim.keymap.set('n', '<leader>mf', function()
	require("galore").withconnect(function ()
		require("galore.telescope").load_draft() end)
	end, {desc='Load draft'})

vim.keymap.set('n', '<leader>mf', function()
	require("galore").withconnect(function ()
		require("galore.thread_message_browser"):create("tag:work", {}) end)
	end, {desc='Open work inbox'})

Buffers                                                    *galore-buffers*

Galore comes with a couple of different buffers to navigate your email

Saved is a buffer for saved searches, selecting a saved search will run that search
in a selected browsers. Saved accepts a list of generators that produce output.
gen_tags: Take all tags the db uses and display them one by one.
gen_internal: All searches we have saved internally and 
    don't want to export into the ecosystem (saved in a file)
gen_excluded: tags excluded from our searches. For example if we exclude archive, 
    then archive will gets it's own entry

Browsers:
A browser lets you browse your messages, with a preview of date, sender(s) and subject. 
Galore comes with 3 browsers depending on your need/preference.
Message browser: Display one message at the time, sorted by date.
Thread browser: Display a thread as one entry, sorted by when the thread resieved it's last message.
Thread message browser: Display messages but group them as threads, displaying a treelike structure.

View:
Views emails and comes in 2 flavours: thread viewer and message viewer.
Thread viewer: View all messages in a thread. Action taken depends on the cursor location.
Message view: View a single message.

Compose:
Write an email, send it, store as a draft or discard it. Compared to mutt, attachments are added
while editing the email (or when generating the response) and displayed as virtual lines at the bottom
of the text. Compose also allows hidden headers (see compose_headers in config), 
to unclutter your mailing experiance.
